# AI Sentiment Analysis API - EKS Deployment

A proof-of-concept sentiment analysis API built with Flask and Hugging Face Transformers, deployed on AWS EKS to demonstrate ML model serving with Kubernetes best practices including autoscaling, rolling updates, and monitoring.

**⚠️ Important Note: This is a POC/Learning Project**

This project is designed for educational purposes and proof-of-concept demonstrations. It is **NOT production-ready** and lacks essential security features. Before using in any production environment, you must implement proper security measures including authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, and network security.

## Features

- **Real-time sentiment analysis** using DistilBERT model
- **Batch processing** for multiple texts
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling** for handling variable loads
- **Rolling deployments** with zero downtime
- **Health checks** and monitoring
- **Load balancing** with AWS LoadBalancer
- **Resource management** optimized for ML workloads
- **API versioning** with detailed confidence analysis
